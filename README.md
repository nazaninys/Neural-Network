# Neural-Network
This project has 2 phases. In the first phase, a feed forward neural network is implemented from scratch and is tested on Fashion Mnist dataset which includes pictures of size 28 * 28 pixels of 10 different clothes.
In the second phase, the TensorFlow library is used to create a neural network for diagnosis of Covid-19 or Pneumonia from patients' CT scans.
